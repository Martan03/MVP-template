# MVP template

This is a PHP MVP template that I use.

## What is MVP?
It is short form of Model View Presenter. This methodology separates presentation and interaction from system data.

Each folder contains its own README file that describes what each directory is for and the files that are in it.

## index.php

This file provides Autoload function so you don't have to require every file you want to use. It then calls ```RouterPresenter```
which then based on URL calls corresponding presenter.
